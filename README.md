# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This project was done on Kaggle Notebooks, so check out the links for datasets in data.txt file 
Engineered robust audio features using MFCC, ZCR, and RMSE to capture spectral, temporal, and energy 
characteristics of speech signals 
Improved model generalization through audio transformations like Gaussian noise injection, pitch shifting 
Designed a complete workflow from raw audio preprocessing to real-time emotion prediction 
Developed an LSTM CNN Model to achieve 95% accuracy
